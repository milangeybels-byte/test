        "direction": "Up",
        "category": "Energy/Commodities",
        "why": "Catalyst is a rebound in oil prices as markets reprice geopolitical and supply risks. Exxon has direct leverage to higher crude prices via upstream earnings. Assumes supply tightens faster than new investment ramps.",

        "official_stock_name": "Chevron Corp",
        "direction": "Up",
        "category": "Energy/Commodities",
        "why": "Rising oil prices would lift cash flows for integrated majors. Chevron is exposed through upstream production and benefits if Venezuelan supply stays constrained. Assumes oil demand remains resilient.",

        "category": "Industrial/Supply chain",
        "why": "Higher oil prices typically trigger increased upstream capex. Halliburton benefits from tighter supply driving investment in mature fields. Assumes operators respond to price signals with spending.",

        "category": "Energy/Commodities",
        "why": "A sharp oil rebound could pressure BP due to its reduced upstream exposure and recent green energy write-downs. Assumes peers with higher oil leverage outperform in a rising crude tape.",
