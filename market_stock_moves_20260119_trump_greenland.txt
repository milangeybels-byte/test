        "category": "Materials",
        "why": "The implied catalyst is declining trust in US assets driving safe-haven demand. Newmont is highly leveraged to gold prices, which investors are rotating into as Treasuries and the dollar weaken. This assumes geopolitical stress sustains risk-off flows.",

        "category": "Financials",
