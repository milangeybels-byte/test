        "direction": "Up",
        "category": "Energy/Commodities",
        "why": "Catalyst is a rebound in oil prices from underpriced geopolitical risk and supply decline. Exxon is highly leveraged to higher crude prices via upstream earnings. Assumes oil supply disruptions or stockpiling tighten balances soon.",

        "official_stock_name": "Chevron Corporation",
        "direction": "Up",
        "category": "Energy/Commodities",
        "why": "Rising crude prices would lift cash flow and margins. Chevron has large upstream exposure and benefits directly if current oversupply reverses. Assumes demand holds and no rapid new supply comes online.",

        "official_stock_name": "SLB",
        "direction": "Up",
        "category": "Energy/Commodities",
        "why": "Higher oil prices typically trigger renewed upstream investment. SLB benefits from increased drilling and field services as producers respond to tighter supply. Assumes capex responds within months, not years.",

        "category": "Energy/Commodities",
        "why": "Oil price upside could offset recent weakness from energy transition writedowns. BP\u2019s earnings remain sensitive to crude prices. Assumes oil rally outweighs investor concerns on strategy.",
